# ⚡💪 fast-odd-even 💪⚡

Are you tired of having to use separate packages like [is-odd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd) or [is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even) to check, if a number is **odd** or **even**? Are you tired of these 🐌 **slow-performing** 🐌 dependencies?

Look no further!

This package provides you with separate functions‚ `isOdd()` and `isEven()`, which do **exactly** what they say! And it does these things ⚡ **_blazingly fast_** ⚡, by utilizing a 👽 **special technique** 👽 called bitwise operations!

## ⚙️ Installation ⚙️

You can install this 💫 **amazing** 💫 tool using our _favourite package manager_ 🤩 **npm** 🤩

```bash
npm install is-odd-even
```

## Usage/Examples

🏃 **Getting started** 🏃 is easy!

```javascript
const { isOdd, isEven } = require("fast-odd-even");

isOdd(5);
// true

isEven(5);
// false
```
